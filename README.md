# NLP Projects
## 1. Word2Vec from scratch
* Write from-scratch of CBOW and Skip-gram models
    
## 2. CNN as Text classfication
  * This project aims to build 1d CNN model for training and evaluating on the text classification task â€” AG_NEWS
  * **Reference paper**: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification
  * [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.5882.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.5882.pdf)

## 3. Char RNN and Random Decoding
  * Char RNN
  * Random Decoding

## 4. Seq2Seq Model for Machine Translation
  * Create a Seq2Seq Model to translate French to English
  * Use word-based Encoder-Decoder to translate word by word in "function:train" and output the translation sentences in "function: trainIters".
  * Evaluate the translation quality using BLEU (both 1-gram and 2-gram)

## 5. GPT Language Model from scratch
* Create Decoder from scratch

## 6. Spam binary classification with GPT2
* Finetune Huggingface GPT2 to make specific binary classification for detecting spam text
